\section{RISC-V \& SAIL}
RISC-V is an open RISC ISA created by researchers at Berkeley University. Its open nature has made it a popular ISA for education and research purposes with a large amount of available tooling.

SAIL is an ISA specification language that can be used to formally describe the semantics of the instructions of an ISA. SAIL models for several different ISA's such as RISC-V, CHERI-RISC-V and ARM have been implemented. SAIL models have a variety of uses, including generating documentation, constructing an emulator and formal reasoning about the ISA.

A SAIL model consists of a series of instruction definitions, code describing their functionality and a mapping between instruction definitions, binary encodings and mnemonic opcodes.
